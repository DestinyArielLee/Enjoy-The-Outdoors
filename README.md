# Enjoy-The-Outdoors
 
This website can be used to search for the National Parks and Mountains in the United States. Find a National Park that suits your tastes by using the "Park Type" search to see which areas have the most scenic views, historical memories, or beautiful preserves. Don't having something that specific in mind? Find a park by "State" to generalize the searches.
Anyone interested in learning about our national Mountains are welcome to use the "Search Mountains" page to find fun facts, elevation, and latitude/longitude!

## Snippet

An interesting feature I used in my homepage are these images that fade in one after the other. They are also clickable links that lead to other sites.
